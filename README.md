# Data Structures in C

This repository contains my implementations of fundamental data structures,
written using C-style programming with a focus on pointers and manual
memory management.

## 📚 Implemented Topics
- Arrays
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List
- Stack (Array-based)
- Stack (Linked List-based)
- String operations
- Matrix operations

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced
- Pointers and dynamic memory allocation
- Manual memory management (malloc / free)
- Struct-based data modeling
- Basic time complexity awareness
- Modular programming in C
